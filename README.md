# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple tic-tac-toe game allowing users to play with another player, or with a bot set on easy difficulty. Planning on refactoring and implementing harder difficulties with use of the mini-max algortihm. Built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

Edit: Refactored now has an unbeatable AI using the minimax algorithm
